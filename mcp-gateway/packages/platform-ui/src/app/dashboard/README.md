# FORGE Internal Development Dashboard

**Route:** `/dashboard`

## Purpose

This dashboard is for **internal FORGE development** - JT working with Claude Code to build FORGE itself.

## Features

- **Epic Progress** - Current development task tracking (e.g., RECOVERY-05)
- **Chat Interface** - Claude assistance for code development
- **Evidence Packs** - Development artifacts from building FORGE
- **CARS Framework** - Security compliance tracking
- **Supply Chain** - Dependency management for FORGE codebase
- **Agent Memory** - Claude's context and session management
- **Verification** - Test results for FORGE's own codebase

## Current Task

Building FORGE's internal features, recovering from architectural decisions, implementing the MCP Gateway, etc.

## Differentiation

- `/dashboard` - **THIS** - Internal FORGE development (JT + Claude building FORGE)
- `/dashboard/generation` - End-user code generation interface (customers using FORGE to generate React code)
