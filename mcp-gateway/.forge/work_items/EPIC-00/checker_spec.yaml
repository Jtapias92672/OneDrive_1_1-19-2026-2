intent:
  summary: |
    Define success criteria (SC-*) for the FORGE platform and establish
    the TRUE-RALPH build system for preventing context rot.
  acceptanceCriteria:
    - "Success criteria definitions (SC-*) documented"
    - "TRUE-RALPH build system documented"
    - "Task-to-criteria mapping established"
    - "Verification protocol defined"
  context: |
    Foundational epic establishing quality standards and build process.
    All subsequent epics reference SC-* criteria from this epic.

risk:
  level: low
  changeSurface: documentation
  factors:
    - "Process documentation only"
  mitigations:
    - "Cross-references validated"
