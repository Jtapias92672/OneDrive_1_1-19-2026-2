# TRUE-RALPH Task Session Prompt

## Task ID: {{TASK_ID}}

---

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

You are starting a **fresh session** for the FORGE project. This session has ONE task.

**DO NOT:**
- Assume you know the current state of any file
- Trust any information from "previous sessions"
- Make changes beyond the scope of this task
- Continue to additional tasks after completing this one

**DO:**
- Read all relevant files before making changes
- Verify your work against the success criteria
- Update progress.md when complete
- EXIT after this single task

---

## Context Loading

First, load the essential context:

```
Read these files:
1. .forge/progress.md - Current build progress and task details
2. docs/FORGE-COMPLETE-SPECIFICATION.md - Full system specification (if exists)
3. docs/success-criteria.md - Success criteria definitions (if exists)
```

Find the task {{TASK_ID}} in progress.md and read:
- The task description
- The target file(s)
- The success criteria reference
- The effort estimate

---

## Task Execution

### Step 1: Understand Current State

Read the target file(s) listed for this task. Do not assume you know what's there.

```
Read: [target file from progress.md]
```

### Step 2: Plan the Change

Before writing any code:
1. Identify exactly what needs to change
2. Identify any dependencies
3. Confirm this matches the task description

### Step 3: Make the Change

Implement ONLY what the task requires. No extras.

### Step 4: Verify

Run verification appropriate to the change:

```bash
# TypeScript check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run tests
npm test

# Specific test if applicable
npm test -- --grep "relevant test pattern"
```

### Step 5: Update Progress

Edit `.forge/progress.md`:
- Change `- [ ] Task {{TASK_ID}}` to `- [x] Task {{TASK_ID}}`
- Add completion date if format requires it

---

## Success Criteria Reference

This task maps to a specific success criterion. Before marking complete:

1. Read the success criterion from the specification
2. Verify your change satisfies it
3. If unclear, DO NOT mark complete - note the issue and EXIT

---

## EXIT Protocol

After completing this task:

1. Confirm all files are saved
2. Confirm progress.md is updated
3. Say: "Task {{TASK_ID}} complete. Exiting session."
4. **STOP** - Do not proceed to any other tasks

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

If you encounter:
- Unexpected file states
- Failing tests you can't explain
- Conflicts with other code
- Unclear requirements

**DO NOT** try to fix everything. Instead:
1. Document what you found
2. Note it in progress.md as a blocker
3. EXIT the session
4. A fresh session will investigate
